# First log into the MBL servers
    
    ssh qdowling@minnie.jbpc-np.mbl.edu

# change to the directory where you will operate. 

    cd /workspace/cardonlab/DOE-THS-TRANSECT

# in a new terminal copy the text file from VAMPs(https://vamps2.mbl.edu/) that contains the taxa and abundance. This file is very specific and is called "Sequence Matrix File (TaxBySeq -- counts matrix)"
