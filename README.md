## HOT SPOTS IN HOT MOMENTS - CHARACTERIZATION OF THE MICROBIAL INHABITANTS WITHIN THE SEDIMENT OF A BRACKISH TIDAL MARSH

## This git contains the steps to recreate the analysis of three separate projects including a temporal analysis, transect from creek bank to the marsh interior, and a project to compare a non-destructive microbial swabbing technique vs. the standard coring
## Each of these projects have their own directory containing detailed analysis, but all of the amplicon sequence variants were called using all samples from each project. This allows for ASV comparison across projects
